                        Blood is a cellular organelle made up of the tangible components of cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets) and plasma. The main role of the blood is to provide nutrients and structure to the organs as well as to remove waste products in the body's metabolism such as carbon dioxide and lactic acid.

                        Donating blood increases calorie burning and aids in weight loss. It is estimated that each donation of 450 ml of blood helps to burn about 650 calories in the body and reduce blood cholesterol. This is a useful measure in weight loss in people with an above-average body weight.
